More shedding than my dog!!,"I wanted to like the bed and at first it worked great, it fit perfectly in my dogs crate and he seemed to be comfortable enough with it. HOWEVER, it sheds like CRAZY! I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could’ve just been their bed. Turns out it’s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn’t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn’t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there.",Fits perfectly in dog's crate,other,neutral

Amazing,So I got the one size regular. I am 5’6 and 176 lbs. I also have a little baby pouch from having kids lol when I first looked at them upon delivery they looked small. I tried them on. There was some extra leg length that bunches up some but not bad. They’re extremely soft. They hid my pouch pretty well. I can also lift my legs high and squat with no feeling of gaining tightness on my legs or anywhere. So they are pretty stretchy as well. I’m happy with them.,softness,other,positive

Uneven flavor.,I love this kind of popcorn and I decided to give the bowl a try. The butter does not distribute evenly over all the popcorn (in all 12 buckets) and there’s extreme amount of salt. You’ll be satisfied at first with its buttery taste but as you get further down into the bowl there’s hardly any flavor. You also have to be on top of when it finishes popping or else the bottom of the bucket gets burnt and you risk burning your popcorn. In my opinion you got more flavor distributed in the single serving bags.,kind of popcorn,other,positive

Not breathable,"I suppose I should have been more suspicious about a mattress cover that claimed to be both breathable and water-proof. The inside of it is lined with some sort of plastic or rubber, which may be waterproof, but is not breathable. You can test this yourself, put it against your lips and blow. No air passes through. There's a softer fabric over the top, but that's not going to provide any sort of air flow. If you have a mattress that's supposed to be breathable or have a cooling effect, a sheet of plastic between you and it pretty much nullifies the effect.",,,

Impressive can and you don’t have to worry about The lid smacking into your counter,"Impressive can, and you don’t have to worry about the lid smacking into your countertop as our old one did, the only downside to this can is that it is a little bit short for me, as I am a 6 foot tall person and when I reach down full extension of my arm I still have to bend down another four or 5 inches to trigger the Cans sensor and I do have a pretty long arms, so if they can was four or 5 inches taller I think it would be a little bit of an improvement.

Cheap table. Defective parts that they refused to replace. They told me to drill the holes myself.,The white faux marble is less than an inch thick and looks really cheap. The legs had the holes on the wrong side so I couldn't complete assembly. The bottom bar that connects stabilizes the table and because the holes where on the wrong side I couldn't install that bar causing the table to be uneven and unstable. I messaged the seller twice and they told me to drill the holes myself and that they couldn't send me correct replacement legs. I'm really disappointed.

Not a perfect fit but it works well and costs 1/3 of the OEM part,"I replaced the original light on our 2012 Armada with this assembly. No issues getting everything hooked up, it's just a pain to get to the light. I actually liked that it didn't come with any pigtails for anything, so I just disconnected everything from the old light after I removed it from the spoiler. I didn't have to run anything back through the liftgate. The fit is not 100% perfect, as the gap at the edge between the light and the cutout in the spoiler is slightly larger than it needs to be. It's not noticeably off, though. Hard to knock it for the price - $40 plus tax. Cheapest I could find from Nissan was about $123.
